## Introduction
This project leverages the Fastf1 library to fetch and analyze Formula 1 race data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the results of races based on historical data. As this is my first project using Python and machine learning, it's intended as a learning exercise. I'm documenting my journey and progress in the hopes that it might help others who are also starting out.

## Features
- Fetch race data using the Fastf1 library
- Preprocess and analyze race data
- Train machine learning models to predict race outcomes
- Evaluate model performance

## Installation
To get started with the Race Results Predictor, you'll need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/race-results-predictor.git
    cd race-results-predictor
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the Race Results Predictor, follow these steps:

1. **Fetch the data:**
    ```bash
    python fetch_data.py
    ```

2. **Train the model:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Make predictions:**
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

Detailed instructions and examples can be found in the respective scripts. As this project evolves, I will be adding more functionalities and improving the existing code.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue. As a beginner, I'm open to all kinds of feedback and advice.
